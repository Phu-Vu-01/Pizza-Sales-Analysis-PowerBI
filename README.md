# üìä Pizza Sales Report - Power BI Dashboard
## üéØ Problem Statement
I analyze this pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. In other words, this is basic data concerning the buy-and-sell transactions in the pizza industry, including the total revenues earned, the total number of orders made, and the customer trends in their preferences. The basis of evaluation goes along the lines of identifying some of the key trends to help improve the data-driven decision-making process.

## KPI's Requirement
+ These measurements and analyses represent the following KPIs:
+ Revenue: The total price of all pizzas.
+ Average Order Value: A measure of the average amount of money spent each time an order is placed; calculated as total revenue divided by total orders.
+ Total Number of Pizzas Sold: The total number of pizzas ordered by each order.
+ Number of Orders: Total number of orders.
+ Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order; is calculated by dividing the Total Pizzas Sold by the Total Orders.

+ Daily Trend For Total ORDERS: A chart in bar form that will illustrate total orders at a daily top-granularity level over the selected period, such that it indicates general patterns or alternations in daily order volumes.
+ Trend of All Orders/Monthly: Chart on flow movement of all orders counted monthly, which allows one to pinpoint the peak months of order activity.
+ % of Sales by Category: A pie chart can be used to record sales distribution according to the categories of pizzas. The classification will help to give an appreciation of the shares pizza categories bear in the total sum volume sold.
+ Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: A pie chart of percentage sales by pizza size will show customer preference for sizes of pizza.
+ Total Number of Pizzas Sold in Each Category for Pizzas: A funnel chart showing a comparison of the total number of pizzas sold versus categories can help to identify the performance in sales for the different categories.

+ The Top 5 Bestsellers in Terms of Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders: A bar graph of the top 5 selling pizzas including revenue, quantity sold, and total orders; this will help to pinpoint what people are ordering the most.
+ The Top 5 Worstsellers in Terms of Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders: A bar graph containing household consumption of 5 least best-selling pizzas, considering revenues, quantities sold, and overall orders in the bar graph. That would therefore assist me in knowing the least favorable pizza choices.
